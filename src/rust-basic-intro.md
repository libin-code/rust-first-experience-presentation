# 🧑‍🏫 &nbsp;Rust history 

As I'm a archaeologist..., let's talk about history!

<br />

* Rust is designed by <span style="color: orange;">Graydon Hoare</span> who worked for Mozilla on 2006, before releasing, it is prepared almost ten years (not 10 days!), it's aim for **solving the security issue within c and c++**

* Rust has been supported by Mozilla Firefox since 2009 and upon its release in 2015

* Almost everyone like Rust since 2016
